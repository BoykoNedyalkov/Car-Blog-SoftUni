Header: Hyundai says it's discussing partnerships with Google

Content: SEOUL -- Hyundai Motor is in discussions with Google about further partnerships
 as the automaker seeks external expertise to remain competitive. The two companies have some
 common areas that may require cooperation, Hyundai Motor President Jeong Jin Haeng said after
 a meeting between the trade ministry and local automakers. Hyundai has been among the most 
active automakers adopting Apple's CarPlay and Google parent Alphabet's Android Auto, 
which integrate iPhone and Android handsets with car dashboards. Jeong didn't give further
 details or confirm if the automaker is considering developing autonomous cars with Google.

Content: Ford Motor Co. today said it plans to introduce an autonomous vehicle by 2021 for
 use in a ride-hailing or ride-sharing service. Ford said the vehicle would be “specifically
 designed for commercial mobility services” and built in high volumes. “Ford is going to be 
mass-producing vehicles with full autonomy in five years,” CEO Mark Fields said at an event
 in Silicon Valley that was broadcast online. “There’s going to be no steering wheel, there’s
 not going to be a gas pedal, there’s not going to be a brake pedal and of course a driver is
 not going to be required.”

Header: For automakers, Detroit's Dream Cruise should be prime turf to recruit engineers, designers.

Content: Earlier this year, Automotive News launched a new publication, Fixed Ops Journal, which
 covers the issues facing managers of the parts, body shop and service departments at new-car dealerships.
 One central theme that appears over and over again in the magazine, as well as in Automotive News’
 reporting on the auto industry, is that from the new-car dealer to the manufacturer -- and suppliers,
 too -- everyone needs more help. Few companies, it seems, can find enough new employees to design, develop
 and engineer tomorrow’s vehicles, advanced powertrains and components. New-car dealers have been in constant
 need of technicians for 20 years. Suppliers need every discipline from battery experts to chemists to code
 writers.

Content: Nissan will offer a five-year/100,000-mile, bumper-to-bumper warranty on the 2017 Titan
 as it prepares to launch two new, volume variants of the large pickup. With the expanded warranty,
 Nissan hopes the Titan, still unfamiliar to many pickup buyers, will garner more consideration from
 truck shoppers.


Header: The McLaren 570GT MSO comes with added gold
Content: Ladies and gents, meet the first McLaren 570GT to get the MSO treatment.
 That stands for McLaren Special Operations, if you need a reminder. 
So what you’re seeing here is a 570 that’s just a little bit more, well, special than the rest.
 It may have ‘GT’ in its name, but the MSO team have decided it definitely needs more noise.
 So there’s a new titanium exhaust system, which is not only 30 per cent lighter than the stainless steel 
item it replaces, but the provider of an “improved aural experience”, too. Good. Not content with titillating
 our ears, MSO is going for our eyes too. The new exhaust gets a set of new heat shields. That’s a more
exciting addition than it sounds, for they are finished in a golden titanium nitride tint. It’s a superb 
nod to a similar treatment in the old McLaren F1. And more superb yet given the shields change through blue
 and purple as they heat up and cool down.


Header: Americans, this is your new Honda Civic
Content: And it's being built in Britain. Don't say we never did anything for you. Welcome, Americans, 
to your brand-new Honda Civic hatchback. Built (probably very well) by the fine men, women and machines of Swindon,
no less, it’ll arrive in dealers this ‘fall’. Whenever that is. Developed by Honda’s R&D teams in Europe and Japan, 
the new Civic promises much. The look is bold (identical to the show car we saw at this year’s Geneva Motor Show), and the handling is touted as ‘world-class’. 
In the US it’s available with just the one engine – a direct-injection 1.5-litre turbocharged four with up to 180bhp and 162lb ft – across five trim levels. When the new Civic eventually reaches Europe sometime next year, expect diesels and a little 1.0-litre triple. A new Type-R, this time also available in the US, will follow. Good. 


Header: The best images from this month's Top Gear magazine
Content: Road trips special: DB11 across Europe, GT-R in Iceland and Disco Volante Spyder in Italy. In the September issue of Top Gear magazine, we hit the road for our annual summer road trip adventures. After a, erm, ‘slightly strained’ few months with Europe, we turn cultural attaches, cross over the channel and take the new 600bhp Aston Martin DB11 for a 2,500-mile trip across the continent. As a perfect example of what the UK stands for in terms of design, creativity, engineering and technology, we find out if the new DB11 can smooth things over with our European neighbours.
